AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

(for scoreboard section add homepage button, view scores button needs to show scoreboard)
